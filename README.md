# device_signout
This is the source code that I used in the full stack development of a website. 
The website was meant to digitize the device sign out process for the digital media company that I worked at.

The package.json file has all the npm packages used in this process listed on there, so all the packages can be installed with 
the npm-installer.

Most of the Node-JS code for the server side, is located at the top most level. The external CSS styling code is located in the 
styles directory. The ejs files for rendering, and the dialog.js file for the dialogs are located in the views folder.
